# rock-paper-scissors
1st JS Project

Computer Choice
Create a function called getComputerChoice and declare a variable called "num"
Use Math.floor and Math.random * 3 to generate a number between 0 and 2
Use If conditional to make console log paper, scissors and rock in different numbers

User Choice
User will input their choice thru a prompt
Create a function called getHumanChoice
Declare a variable called "choice"
Will use prompt to give the choice to the user between rock, paper, scissors

Create a new function named playRound.
Define two parameters for playRound: humanChoice and computerChoice. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.
Make your function’s humanChoice parameter case-insensitive so that players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.

Increment the humanScore or computerScore variable based on the round winner.
Done by adding each variable to respective conditional value and ++
inserted console log with backsicks and added the comment

will make the new function loop 5 times
have to store the function inside the variable instead of the function value
will make console log the round number as well as the winner by using an if conditional.
after that will invoque the new function inside the
